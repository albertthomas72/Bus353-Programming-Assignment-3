# Programming-Assignment-3

Dear programmer, 

This was a very well put together program, I believe that I have already commented but want to make sure that this goes through. 
There was a problem or "bug" perhaps with line 46 on my end with your program. I put it into my titanium and it said that you were missing a semicolon and also that you are missing a "  "   " piece because the words were undefined. 

Other than this it all worked very well and ran smoothly at least on my computer!
